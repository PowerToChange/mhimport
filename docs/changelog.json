The old behavior was to coerce the arguments into Strings,\nwhich did surprising things with Arrays.</p>\n\n<h2>v0.6.5 - July 6, 2011</h2>\n\n<p>Contributed changes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Support SlowBuffers (Umair Siddique)</li>\n<li>Add Multi to exports (Louis-Philippe Perron)</li>\n<li>Fix for drain event calculation (Vladimir Dronnikov)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n\n<h2>v0.6.4 - June 30, 2011</h2>\n\n<p>Fix bug with optional callbacks for hmset.</p>\n\n<h2>v0.6.2 - June 30, 2011</h2>\n\n<p>Bugs fixed:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>authentication retry while server is loading db (danmaz74) [GH-101]</li>\n<li>command arguments processing issue with arrays</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>New features:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Auto update of new commands from redis.io (Dave Hoover)</li>\n<li>Performance improvements and backpressure controls.</li>\n<li>Commands now return the true/false value from the underlying socket write(s).</li>\n<li>Implement command_queue high water and low water for more better control of queueing.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>See <code>examples/backpressure_drain.js</code> for more information.</p>\n\n<h2>v0.6.1 - June 29, 2011</h2>\n\n<p>Add support and tests for Redis scripting through EXEC command.</p>\n\n<p>Bug fix for monitor mode.  (forddg)</p>\n\n<p>Auto update of new commands from redis.io (Dave Hoover)</p>\n\n<h2>v0.6.0 - April 21, 2011</h2>\n\n<p>Lots of bugs fixed.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>connection error did not properly trigger reconnection logic [GH-85]</li>\n<li>client.hmget(key, [val1, val2]) was not expanding properly [GH-66]</li>\n<li>client.quit() while in pub/sub mode would throw an error [GH-87]</li>\n<li>client.multi(['hmset', 'key', {foo: 'bar'}]) fails [GH-92]</li>\n<li>unsubscribe before subscribe would make things very confused [GH-88]</li>\n<li>Add BRPOPLPUSH [GH-79]</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>v0.5.11 - April 7, 2011</h2>\n\n<p>Added DISCARD</p>\n\n<p>I originally didn't think DISCARD would do anything here because of the clever MULTI interface, but somebody\npointed out to me that DISCARD can be used to flush the WATCH set.</p>\n\n<h2>v0.5.10 - April 6, 2011</h2>\n\n<p>Added HVALS</p>\n\n<h2>v0.5.9 - March 14, 2011</h2>\n\n<p>Fix bug with empty Array arguments - Andy Ray</p>\n\n<h2>v0.5.8 - March 14, 2011</h2>\n\n<p>Add <code>MONITOR</code> command and special monitor command reply parsing.</p>\n\n<h2>v0.5.7 - February 27, 2011</h2>\n\n<p>Add magical auth command.</p>\n\n<p>Authentication is now remembered by the client and will be automatically sent to the server\non every connection, including any reconnections.</p>\n\n<h2>v0.5.6 - February 22, 2011</h2>\n\n<p>Fix bug in ready check with <code>return_buffers</code> set to <code>true</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to Dean Mao and Austin Chau.</p>\n\n<h2>v0.5.5 - February 16, 2011</h2>\n\n<p>Add probe for server readiness.</p>\n\n<p>When a Redis server starts up, it might take a while to load the dataset into memory.\nDuring this time, the server will accept connections, but will return errors for all non-INFO\ncommands.  Now node_redis will send an INFO command whenever it connects to a server.\nIf the info command indicates that the server is not ready, the client will keep trying until\nthe server is ready.  Once it is ready, the client will emit a \"ready\" event as well as the\n\"connect\" event.  The client will queue up all commands sent before the server is ready, just\nlike it did before.  When the server is ready, all offline/non-ready commands will be replayed.\nThis should be backward compatible with previous versions.</p>\n\n<p>To disable this ready check behavior, set <code>options.no_ready_check</code> when creating the client.</p>\n\n<p>As a side effect of this change, the key/val params from the info command are available as\n<code>client.server_options</code>.  Further, the version string is decomposed into individual elements\nin <code>client.server_options.versions</code>.</p>\n\n<h2>v0.5.4 - February 11, 2011</h2>\n\n<p>Fix excess memory consumption from Queue backing store.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to Gustaf Sj√∂berg.</p>\n\n<h2>v0.5.3 - February 5, 2011</h2>\n\n<p>Fix multi/exec error reply callback logic.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to Stella Laurenzo.</p>\n\n<h2>v0.5.2 - January 18, 2011</h2>\n\n<p>Fix bug where unhandled error replies confuse the parser.</p>\n\n<h2>v0.5.1 - January 18, 2011</h2>\n\n<p>Fix bug where subscribe commands would not handle redis-server startup error properly.</p>\n\n<h2>v0.5.0 - December 29, 2010</h2>\n\n<p>Some bug fixes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>An important bug fix in reconnection logic.  Previously, reply callbacks would be invoked twice after\na reconnect.</li>\n<li>Changed error callback argument to be an actual Error object.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>New feature:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Add friendly syntax for HMSET using an object.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>v0.4.1 - December 8, 2010</h2>\n\n<p>Remove warning about missing hiredis.  You probably do want it though.</p>\n\n<h2>v0.4.0 - December 5, 2010</h2>\n\n<p>Support for multiple response parsers and hiredis C library from Pieter Noordhuis.\nReturn Strings instead of Buffers by default.\nEmpty nested mb reply bug fix.</p>\n\n<h2>v0.3.9 - November 30, 2010</h2>\n\n<p>Fix parser bug on failed EXECs.</p>\n\n<h2>v0.3.8 - November 10, 2010</h2>\n\n<p>Fix for null MULTI response when WATCH condition fails.</p>\n\n<h2>v0.3.7 - November 9, 2010</h2>\n\n<p>Add \"drain\" and \"idle\" events.</p>\n\n<h2>v0.3.6 - November 3, 2010</h2>\n\n<p>Add all known Redis commands from Redis master, even ones that are coming in 2.2 and beyond.</p>\n\n<p>Send a friendlier \"error\" event message on stream errors like connection refused / reset.</p>\n\n<h2>v0.3.5 - October 21, 2010</h2>\n\n<p>A few bug fixes.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed bug with <code>nil</code> multi-bulk reply lengths that showed up with <code>BLPOP</code> timeouts.</li>\n<li>Only emit <code>end</code> once when connection goes away.</li>\n<li>Fixed bug in <code>test.js</code> where driver finished before all tests completed.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>unversioned wasteland</h2>\n\n<p>See the git history for what happened before.</p>", "src": "appDev/node_modules/socket.io/node_modules/redis/changelog.md", "children": []})
