/**
 * @class AD.Comm.Dispatch
 * @parent AD.Comm
 * 
 * The Dispatch object provides a publish/subscribe notification system for
 * communication between the server and the clients and between clients.
 * 
 * For example, when a user logs into the site, a message might be sent to
 * the other clients to notify them of the new user.
 * 
 * ## Usage
 * 
 * To notify the other clients that a user has logged out you would publish a message:
 * @codestart
 * AD.Comm.Dispatch.publish('/userNotifications/logout', {id: 53, name: 'John Doe'});
 * @codeend
 * 
 * 
 * To respond to the logout, you would to subscribe to the logout channel:
 * @codestart
 * var userLogout = function(user) {
 *     alert(user.name+' just logged out.');
 * };
 * AD.Comm.Dispatch.subscribe('/userNotifications/logout', userLogout);
 * @codeend
 * 
 * Now every time a user logs out, the userLogout function is called with the user's information.
 * 
 * ## Wildcards
 * 
 * From the Faye website:
 * 
 * Channel names must be formatted as absolute path names whose segments may contain only letters,
 * numbers, and the symbols -, _, !, ~, (, ), $ and @.  Channel names may also end with wildcards:
 * 
 * * The * wildcard matches any channel segment. So /foo/* matches /foo/bar and /foo/thing but not /foo/bar/thing.
 * * The ** wildcard matches any channel name recursively. So /foo/** matches /foo/bar, /foo/thing and /foo/bar/thing.
 * 
 * So for example if you subscribe to /foo/* and someone sends a message to /foo/bar, you will receive that message.
 * 
 * ## Canceling subscriptions
 * 
 * If at some point it is no longer necessary to listen for certain messages, you can
 * cancel your subscription at any time.
 * 
 * @codestart
 * var callback = function(message) {
 *     if (message.stopListening) {
 *         subscription.cancel();
 *     }
 *     alert('Message received: '+message.text);
 * };
 * var subscription = AD.Comm.Dispatch.subscribe('/message', callback);
 * 
 * AD.Comm.Notification.publish('/message', {text: 'You will receive this', stopListening: true});
 * AD.Comm.Notification.publish('/message', {text: 'But you will not receive this'});
 * @codeend
 *
